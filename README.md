# Remscroll
Because scrolling to the old location on your tab after restarting your browser is a waste of time.

## About
A simple Chrome Extension where you can save your scroll location for later use!
Thanks to @MaxxxFoxxx for coming up with the concept.

## Installation
- Clone the repository or download the zip (extract this to a folder)
- Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
- Click "Load unpacked extension…" (Enable developer mode if the button is not there)
- Select the repository/folder
- All done!
