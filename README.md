# NOTE
This is an archived repository from 2017, that I'm keeping up mostly so I can look back at my past code.

# Remscroll
Because scrolling to the old location on your tab after restarting your browser is a waste of time.

## About
A simple Chrome Extension where you can save your scroll location for later use!
Thanks to @MaxxxFoxxx for coming up with the concept.

## Installation
- Clone the repository or download the zip (extract this to a folder)
- Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
- Click "Load unpacked extensionï¿½" (Enable developer mode if the button is not there)
- Select the repository/folder
- You can probably disable developer mode afterwards. Maybe you cannot. Not my problem!
- All done!

## Contributing
Have any suggestions? Great! I prefer suggestions in an Issue Tracker, however Pull Requests are also appreciated.

## Troubleshooting
- Why not package this into an extension file?
Because chrome doesn't allow packaged extensions that don't come from the Chrome Extension store thing.

- Why not upload it there then?
Because I am not paying the entry fee unless I make more extensions in the future.
